      On initial application load, a language tag is selected. You might wonder
      how is the language tag chosen? Qint prioritizes a language tag &ldquo;URL
      prefix&rdquo; if it exists (for example <code>/en/blog</code>), if not, it
      looks for a previously set &ldquo;cookie&rdquo;, if no cookie is found, it
      falls back to the default language tag set in your Qint configuration.
    </p>

    <p>Note that the use of the URL prefix or the cookie is optional.</p>

    <p>
      A language tag selection can also be triggered in other ways, for example
      when changing to a route in a different language tag.
    </p>

    <p>Whenever a language tag selection is triggered, few things happen:</p>

    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>
        The vue-i18n messages corresponding to the new language tag are loaded,
        and the locale of vue-i18n instance is changed to the new language tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        The corresponding Quasar language pack is loaded and set for the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        The language tag cookie is set or updated with the new language tag.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Qint also provides a smart language selector component. When a translation
      for the current page exists in the target language tag, the selector
      switches to it, otherwise, it will switch to the home page of the target
      language tag.
